# Story 6.4: Bypass Detection & Cascade Rescheduling

Status: ready-for-review

## Story

As a VA (agency owner),
I want to know when clients bypass me for scheduling and have cascade rescheduling handled,
so that I maintain control over client calendar management.

## Adversarial Review Summary

This story was hardened by adversarial review (18 findings). Key changes from the raw epics spec:

1. **Config bug fix**: `bypassAlertThreshold` corrected from 0.8 (data entry error) to 0.3 per spec
2. **Source classification added**: Events stamped `unknown` by 6-1 need re-classification for bypass detection to work
3. **Bypass metrics table**: Dedicated `calendar_bypass_metrics` table instead of agent state JSONB (queryable by Client Health)
4. **30-day rolling window**: Bypass rate calculated over defined window (was undefined in spec)
5. **Event relations table**: `calendar_event_relations` for cascade dependency tracking (spec had no schema)
6. **Saga pattern for cascades**: Compensating transactions with rollback on partial failure
7. **Daily preview as signal**: Calendar Agent emits `calendar.daily_preview` signal consumed by Morning Brief (not a UI story)
8. **UX-DR reference corrected**: Bypass inbox items reference UX-DR21/UX-DR22, not UX-DR10

## Acceptance Criteria

0. **[AC0 -- Test-First]** Unit test stubs exist and are red before implementation begins. Story cannot be marked `in-progress` until test file with failing tests is created.

### Part A: Bypass Detection

1. **[AC1 -- Source classification]** Given the Calendar Agent has connected calendars with events synced, when an event is synced (initial or incremental) or created via Flow OS, then the agent classifies the event `source` field using heuristic rules per calendar-agent-spec.md Section 4.3: organizer matches VA email -> `va_created`; organizer matches client contact -> `client_created`; organizer matches Calendly/Acuity/Zoom patterns -> `third_party`; recurring holiday/OOO -> `auto_generated`; else -> `unknown` (treated conservatively as `client_created`). Events with `source = 'unknown'` from initial sync (story 6-1) are re-classified on their first update via incremental sync.

2. **[AC2 -- Bypass detection trigger]** Given a new or updated event classified as `source = 'client_created'`, when the Calendar Agent processes it, then it checks whether the event was preceded by a scheduling request handled by the VA (query `scheduling_requests` for matching `client_id` with `status IN ('booked', 'option_selected')` within a 24-hour window before the event `created_at`). If no matching scheduling request exists, the event is flagged as a bypass per FR28m.

3. **[AC3 -- Bypass rate tracking]** Given a bypass event is detected, when the agent records it, then it upserts into a `calendar_bypass_metrics` table keyed by `(workspace_id, client_id, window_start)` with rolling 30-day windows. Columns: `total_events`, `bypass_count`, `bypass_rate` (NUMERIC 5,4). Previous windows are preserved for trend analysis. NOT stored in agent state JSONB.

4. **[AC4 -- Bypass threshold alert]** Given bypass metrics exist for a client, when `bypass_rate` exceeds `bypassAlertThreshold` (default 0.3 = 30%), then the Calendar Agent emits a `calendar.bypass_detected` signal with dedup key `cal.bypass:{client_id}:{YYYY-MM-DD}` (daily dedup per client) per spec Section 5.1, and surfaces an informational item in the agent inbox showing client name, bypass count, bypass rate, and most recent bypass event details per FR28m.

5. **[AC5 -- Bypass signal format for Client Health]** Given a `calendar.bypass_detected` signal is emitted, the payload includes `{ client_id, bypass_count, bypass_rate, recent_event_id }` per spec Section 5.1. Client Health agent integration (Epic 8) is NOT in scope -- this AC verifies signal emission format only.

6. **[AC6 -- Config threshold correction]** Given the existing `DEFAULT_CALENDAR_CONFIG.bypassAlertThreshold` is `0.8` (data entry error from story 6-1), when this story is implemented, then it is corrected to `0.3` to match calendar-agent-spec.md Section 3.5 and Section 6.2.

### Part B: Cascade Rescheduling

7. **[AC7 -- Event dependency tracking]** Given a booking is created via the Calendar Agent (story 6-3 `create_event` action), when a scheduling request with `request_type = 'reschedule'` creates a new event, then a `rescheduled_from` relation is written to a new `calendar_event_relations` table linking the old event to the new one. The table supports relation types: `prep_time`, `travel_time`, `debrief`, `rescheduled_from` -- but only `rescheduled_from` is written in MVP.

8. **[AC8 -- Cascade trigger]** Given a calendar event is cancelled or rescheduled (detected via sync), when the event has `source = 'va_created'` or `created_via = 'flow_os'`, then the Calendar Agent identifies dependent events by: (a) querying `calendar_event_relations` for the affected event ID, and (b) querying events in the same workspace with same `client_id` whose `start_at` falls within +/-2 hours of the original event time (heuristic proximity fallback).

9. **[AC9 -- Cascade proposal]** Given dependent events are identified, when the Calendar Agent generates a cascade proposal, then it creates a single `agent_runs` record with `action_type = 'resolveCascade'` at trust level 1 (suggest/confirm), proposes up to 3 resolution options via the existing approval queue (Epic 2). Each option describes the full set of affected events and proposed changes. The proposal renders as a single unified card, not individual cards per event.

10. **[AC10 -- Cascade execution with saga]** Given the VA approves a cascade option, when the Calendar Agent executes it, then it updates each affected event via `provider.updateEvent()` sequentially. If any update fails, the system rolls back previously updated events to their original state (compensating transactions per NFR20). The saga result is recorded in `agent_runs.metadata` with `{ executed: [{eventId, action}], rolled_back: [{eventId, action}] }`.

11. **[AC11 -- Cascade signal emission]** Given a cascade proposal is created OR a cascade execution completes (success or partial failure), when the terminal state is reached, then the Calendar Agent emits a `calendar.cascade_triggered` signal with payload `{ origin_event_id, affected_count, events_affected: [{eventId, action}] }` per spec Section 5.1.

### Part C: Daily Calendar Preview

12. **[AC12 -- Daily preview for Morning Brief]** Given the Calendar Agent is active with connected calendars, when the daily scheduled run fires (6:45 AM workspace-local time), then the Calendar Agent generates a daily preview payload containing: (a) today's upcoming events sorted by time, (b) unresolved conflicts from `agent_signals`, (c) bypass alerts from `calendar_bypass_metrics`, (d) available gap suggestions. The preview is stored as a `calendar.daily_preview` signal consumed by the Morning Brief generator (Epic 4, story 4-3). Morning Brief UI integration is NOT in scope per FR28o.

## Pre-Dev Dependency Scan

- [x] Graphify query run -- key dependencies listed below
- [x] Dependencies: packages/agents/calendar/*, packages/db/src/schema/calendar-events.ts, packages/db/src/schema/scheduling-requests.ts, packages/agents/providers/calendar-provider.ts
- [x] UX AC review -- Bypass items surface as informational in agent inbox (UX-DR21, UX-DR22). Cascade proposals use existing approval queue (Epic 2). Daily preview is signal-only (no UI in this story).
- [x] Architect sign-off -- follows established patterns from 6-1/6-2/6-3 (provider abstraction, worker extension, signal pattern). No novel architecture.

## Dev Notes

### Config Threshold Correction

The existing `DEFAULT_CALENDAR_CONFIG.bypassAlertThreshold` is `0.8` (80%). The calendar-agent-spec.md Section 3.5 specifies `0.3` (30%) and Section 6.2 says "default 30%". The 0.8 value was a data entry error in story 6-1. This story corrects it to `0.3`.

### Event Source Classification Strategy

| Source | Detection Method | Confidence |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| `va_created` | Organizer matches VA email (from `client_calendars.email_address`) OR `created_via = 'flow_os'` | High |
| `client_created` | Organizer matches client contact email AND on client calendar without VA action | High |
| `third_party` | Organizer domain matches Calendly/Acuity/Zoom patterns | Medium |
| `auto_generated` | Recurring holiday/OOO events, Google auto-generated | High |
| `unknown` | Cannot determine -> treated as `client_created` (conservative) | N/A |

For existing `source = 'unknown'` events: re-classified lazily on first sync update. Bulk re-classification is NOT in scope.

### Cascade Dependency Detection (MVP)

Two dependency sources:

1. **Explicit relations**: `calendar_event_relations` with `rescheduled_from` links
2. **Heuristic proximity**: Same workspace, same `client_id`, `start_at` within +/-2 hours of cancelled/moved event

Prep/travel/debrief relation creation is deferred to Growth phase. Table supports those types but no code writes them in MVP.

### Saga Pattern for Cascade Execution (NFR20)

```
1. Snapshot original state of all affected events (title, start, end, location)
2. For each event update:
   a. Call provider.updateEvent()
   b. Update calendar_events in DB
   c. Record action in saga log
3. If any step fails:
   a. For each completed action (reverse order):
      i. Call provider.updateEvent() with original values
      ii. Update calendar_events back to original
   b. Record rollback in agent_runs.metadata
   c. Emit cascade signal with partial_failure status
```

### Daily Preview Signal Format

```
signal_type: 'calendar.daily_preview'
target_agent: 'inbox'
payload: {
  date: '2026-05-24',
  events: [{ title, startAt, endAt, clientName, source }],
  conflicts: [{ eventTitle, conflictTitle, startAt }],
  bypassAlerts: [{ clientName, bypassRate, recentEvent }],
  gaps: [{ startAt, endAt, durationMinutes, suggestion }]
}
```

### Signals Produced (this story)

| Signal | Emitted By | Consumed By | Dedup Key |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| `calendar.bypass_detected` | Task 4 | Client Health (Epic 8), VA inbox | `cal.bypass:{client_id}:{date}` |
| `calendar.cascade_triggered` | Task 5 | VA inbox | `cal.cascade:{origin_event_id}` |
| `calendar.daily_preview` | Task 7 | Morning Brief (Epic 4) | `cal.preview:{workspace_id}:{date}` |

### Existing Code to Build Upon

| File | What It Provides | How 6-4 Uses It |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| `packages/agents/calendar/conflict-detection.ts` | `detectConflictsForEvent()` | Reused for cascade conflict checking |
| `packages/agents/calendar/conflict-signals.ts` | `writeConflictSignals()` | Pattern for bypass/cascade signal writers |
| `packages/agents/calendar/create-event-action.ts` | Event creation flow | Extended with `rescheduled_from` relation writing |
| `packages/agents/calendar/signal-consumer.ts` | Signal consumption pattern | Bypass detection triggered from sync signals |
| `packages/agents/calendar/slot-finder.ts` | `findAvailableSlots()` | Reused for cascade resolution options |
| `packages/agents/orchestrator/calendar-worker.ts` | Worker registration | Extended with detectBypass, resolveCascade handlers |
| `packages/agents/providers/calendar-provider.ts` | `updateEvent()`, `deleteEvent()` | Cascade execution calls updateEvent per affected event |
| `packages/db/src/schema/calendar-events.ts` | `calendar_events` with `source` column | Bypass detection reads from this |
| `packages/db/src/schema/scheduling-requests.ts` | `scheduling_requests` table | Bypass detection queries for matching requests |
| `packages/agents/calendar/config.ts` | `DEFAULT_CALENDAR_CONFIG` | Threshold corrected from 0.8 to 0.3 |
| `packages/agents/calendar/types.ts` | `CalendarActionType`, `CalendarTrustLevels` | Already includes `detectBypass`, `resolveCascade` |

### Architecture Patterns

- **Provider abstraction**: Never import `googleapis` outside `packages/agents/providers/google-calendar/`. [Source: architecture.md]
- **Agent module isolation**: Zero cross-agent imports. Communication via `agent_signals` only. [Source: architecture.md]
- **Signal deduplication**: Use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` with `dedup_key`. [Source: 6-2 pattern]
- **Zod at DB boundaries**: Every Supabase row mapping MUST use Zod. [Source: project-context.md]
- **200-line file limit**: Decompose if needed. Functions <=50 lines logic. [Source: project-context.md]
- **RLS pattern**: `workspace_id::text` JWT cast mandatory. [Source: project-context.md]

### Scope Decisions (from Adversarial Review)

| Item | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Bypass pattern detection ("Client B tends to book Fridays") | DEFERRED | Requires 30+ events per client. MVP tracks rate only |
| Prep/travel/debrief relation creation | DEFERRED | Table supports it but no code writes those types |
| Weekly preview (Monday 6:30 AM) | DEFERRED | Reporting feature -- belongs in Epic 8 |
| Incremental sync implementation | OUT OF SCOPE | Prerequisite, not part of this story |
| Client Health agent integration | OUT OF SCOPE | This story emits the signal. Epic 8 consumes it |
| Morning Brief UI changes | OUT OF SCOPE | This story emits the signal. Epic 4 renders it |
| Bulk re-classification of `unknown` events | DEFERRED | Lazy re-classification on update is sufficient |

### Deferred Items (at creation)

| Item | Reason | Deferred to | Spec Section |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Bypass pattern detection (per-day, per-time) | Requires 30+ events per client | Growth phase | Spec 6.2 |
| Prep/travel/debrief relation types | Table supports, no code writes | Growth phase | Spec 6.2 |
| Weekly preview generation | Reporting feature | Epic 8 | Spec 6.3 |
| Travel time via Maps API | Requires external API | Growth phase | Spec 12.6 |
| Portal self-service scheduling | Requires portal infra | Growth phase | Spec 8.1-8.2 |
| Bulk re-classification of unknown events | Lazy re-classification sufficient | Growth phase | Spec 4.3 |

### Previous Story Learnings (from 6-1, 6-2, 6-3)

- Provider timeout: always use `Promise.race` with 30s, not AbortController-only (6-2 fix)
- Signal dedup: `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` with dedup_key (6-2 pattern)
- Source classification: initial sync stamps `unknown`, re-classification is incremental (6-1 decision)
- Agent state JSONB is for transient data; persistent metrics need dedicated tables (6-3 learning)
- Worker registration: extend existing `calendar-worker.ts`, don't create new workers (6-2 pattern)
- Zod schemas for ALL DB boundaries -- no exceptions (6-3 code review finding)
- safeParse() not parse() in workers -- crash leaves variables unbound in catch (6-3 finding)
- ALWAYS add workspace_id filter on service client queries (6-3 H1 finding)

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

zai-coding-plan/glm-5.1

### Debug Log References

- All 9 tasks completed. 46 unit tests passing (15 classify-source + 4 detect-bypass + 4 resolve-cascade + 3 daily-preview + 6 event-relations + 14 bypass-metrics).
- Pre-existing test failures (orchestrator-factory, categorizer) are NOT from this story.
- File length issues resolved by extracting `cascade-executor.ts` and `calendar-bypass-worker.ts`.

### Completion Notes

- `ResolveCascadeDeps` does not include `getProvider` (removed during lint fix — cascade proposal doesn't need provider). `executeCascadeOption` in `cascade-executor.ts` has its own deps with `getProvider`.
- Source classification wired into `initial-sync.ts` batch upsert with optional `vaEmail`/`calendars` params.
- `calendar_event_relations` does NOT have `workspace_id` column — uses EXISTS subquery joining `calendar_events` for RLS.
- Daily preview uses `split('T')[0]` with fallback for `noUncheckedIndexedArrayAccess`.

### Review Findings

**Decision-Needed (7)**

- [ ] [Review][Decision] signal_type CHECK constraint rejects all new signals — `agent_signals.signal_type` uses `CHECK (signal_type ~ '^[a-z-]+\.[a-z]+\.[a-z]+$')` which rejects underscores. All 6-4 signals (`calendar.bypass_detected`, `calendar.cascade_triggered`, `calendar.daily_preview`) fail. Pre-existing: `conflict_detected` from 6-2 also fails. Decision: alter constraint to allow underscores (`'^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*\\.[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*\\.[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$'`), or change signal_type format to 3-segment dots (`calendar.bypass.detected`)? [bypass-metrics.ts, detect-bypass-action.ts, resolve-cascade-action.ts, daily-preview.ts, cascade-executor.ts + migration 20260426090002]
- [ ] [Review][Decision] No `dedup_key` column in `agent_signals` — all signal inserts include `dedup_key` field which doesn't exist in the table. Decision: add `dedup_key` column + unique constraint (migration), or remove `dedup_key` from all insert calls and use application-level dedup? [all signal-emitting files]
- [ ] [Review][Decision] `unknown` source not treated as `client_created` per AC1 — spec says "unknown → treated conservatively as client_created" but code stores `'unknown'` literally. Bypass detection only checks `source = 'client_created'`. Decision: return `'client_created'` from classifier for unknown, or update bypass detection to also process `'unknown'`? [classify-source.ts:38, detect-bypass-action.ts]
- [ ] [Review][Decision] Cascade option 2 ("move-to-vacated") is identical to option 3 ("keep-as-is") — both use `action: 'keep'`. AC9 requires meaningful alternatives. Decision: implement move-to-vacated logic using slot-finder, or remove the duplicate option? [resolve-cascade-action.ts:136-146]
- [ ] [Review][Decision] Bypass detection not triggered from any pipeline — worker handles `detectBypass` but nothing enqueues it. No code calls it after sync or classification. Decision: wire into initial-sync.ts / incremental sync / signal consumer? [calendar-worker.ts, initial-sync.ts, signal-consumer.ts]
- [ ] [Review][Decision] `incrementTotalEvents` exists but never called — bypass_rate denominator (total_events) only grows from bypass events, inflating rate to ~1.0. AC3 requires tracking ALL events. Decision: call from sync pipeline for every event, or restructure bypass-metrics to separate counting? [bypass-metrics.ts:99-130]
- [ ] [Review][Decision] Signal payload uses camelCase but spec requires snake_case — AC5 specifies `{ client_id, bypass_count, bypass_rate, recent_event_id }`. Code uses `{ clientId, bypassCount, bypassRate, recentEventId }`. Decision: change to snake_case at boundary, or update spec? [detect-bypass-action.ts:63-66]

**Patch (14)**

- [ ] [Review][Patch] Race condition on bypass metrics upsert — read-then-write without atomicity; concurrent bypasses for same client lose updates [bypass-metrics.ts:50-73]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Cascade rollback uses updateEvent on deleted events — cancel action calls deleteEvent then rollback tries updateEvent on nonexistent provider event [cascade-executor.ts:96-118]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Cascade executor passes empty string as access token to provider — every provider call will fail with auth error [cascade-executor.ts:81,86,104]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Saga result not recorded in agent_runs.metadata — AC10 requires `{ executed, rolled_back }` in metadata; no code writes it [cascade-executor.ts, calendar-bypass-worker.ts]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Daily preview schedule ignores workspace timezone — cron fires at 06:45 UTC, not workspace-local time [calendar-bypass-worker.ts:1400]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Daily preview bypass alerts don't filter by threshold — shows ALL clients with any bypass instead of rate > 0.3 [daily-preview.ts:106]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Daily preview uses server-local new Date() for timezone — "today" misaligned when server TZ ≠ workspace TZ [daily-preview.ts:63-68]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Zod at DB boundaries violated systematically — all Supabase row mappings use raw `as` casts instead of Zod schemas [bypass-metrics.ts, resolve-cascade-action.ts, daily-preview.ts, event-relations.ts, cascade-executor.ts]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] RLS for calendar_event_relations only validates parent_event_id workspace, not child_event_id — cross-workspace data leak [migration SQL]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] classifyAndUpdateEvent silently ignores Supabase update errors — events stay as `unknown` [classify-source.ts:81-86]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] findDependentEvents has no workspace filter — service_role client could return cross-workspace relations [event-relations.ts:56-59]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Daily preview bypass alerts missing client name for clients not on today's calendar — clientMap only built from event client_ids [daily-preview.ts:80-90]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] cascade rollback stops at first failure — leaves partial state with no tracking of un-rolled-back events [cascade-executor.ts:113-117]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Scheduled daily preview job has no workspace_id in payload — worker bails immediately on every run [calendar-bypass-worker.ts:1400-1409]

**Deferred (7)**

- [x] [Review][Defer] service_role RLS policies target authenticated role — dead policy, pre-existing pattern from earlier stories [migration SQL] — deferred, pre-existing
- [x] [Review][Defer] bypass_metrics window_start filter fragments metrics across rolling window shifts — window management needs rethink [bypass-metrics.ts:38] — deferred, needs product input on window strategy
- [x] [Review][Defer] getRollingWindow() non-deterministic millisecond boundaries — causes unnecessary row creation [bypass-metrics.ts:20-25] — deferred, coupled to window management rethink
- [x] [Review][Defer] First bypass triggers immediate alert (rate=1.0 > 0.3) — may be undesirable, minimum event threshold needed [detect-bypass-action.ts:61] — deferred, product decision on minimum sample size
- [x] [Review][Defer] cascade executor non-cancel update path sends empty payload — currently unreachable but dead code [cascade-executor.ts:763-769] — deferred, blocked on option 2 implementation
- [x] [Review][Defer] empty catch without comment in rollback path — project rule violation [cascade-executor.ts:793] — deferred, coupled to rollback rework
- [x] [Review][Defer] operator precedence: `source ?? 'unknown' as const` widens type — `as const` binds tighter than `??` [initial-sync.ts:121] — deferred, cosmetic, TypeScript still infers correctly

**Dismissed (2)**

- runId parameter voided in action functions — intentional pattern from earlier stories, not a defect
- Unit tests use non-UUID strings — tests bypass worker validation layer by design
